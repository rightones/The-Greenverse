Drawing from underwater datacenters which multiple agents such as humans, seawater, marine animals, metal, and data are knotted together, we aim to understand green technology as a symbiosis between humans and non-humans, not a human centered practice.",

            "“Combating climate change is always controversial and inevitably political. However within all the debates and politics, there is always love; a love that is so irrational that it points to every human being, animal, and object in this world. Love is radical.”",

Among them, Microsoft’s ‘Project Natick’ undergone to understand the feasibility of locally powered and recyclable underwater datacenters, showed sustainable underwater datacenters to be practical.",
            "The strange juxtaposition of a huge metal cylinder placed on the seabed looks somewhat intrusive, while also giving a sense of a futuristic utopia. With this paradoxical feeling as our starting point, we suggest that instead of evaluating the project within the dichotomy of good and bad or success and failure, we understand it as a contingent practice of living together where the divide between natural/unnatural, and living/non-living are queered.",
