Among them, Microsoft’s ‘Project Natick’ undergone to understand the feasibility of locally powered and recyclable underwater datacenters, showed sustainable underwater datacenters to be practical.",
            "The strange juxtaposition of a huge metal cylinder placed on the seabed looks somewhat intrusive, while also giving a sense of a futuristic utopia. With this paradoxical feeling as our starting point, we suggest that instead of evaluating the project within the dichotomy of good and bad or success and failure, we understand it as a contingent practice of living together where the divide between natural/unnatural, and living/non-living are queered.",

Electricity used for data usage now is equivalent to that of what is used for aviation all combined, and methods of using data sustainability have been an important question amongst IT companies. Project Natick was one of them, and it returned a positive result by showing that underwater datacenters are practical, reliable, sustainable, and economically beneficial.",
            "The lights-out datacenter model stands out in that it uses 100% sustainable energy by utilizing cool seawater, and the absence of humans. It also has fewer errors, more efficiency regarding sending out data and is easy to repair. ",
            "The cool seawater allows an energy-efficient design for the datacenter, for instance by adapting the heat exchanger system of submarines. This kind of efficiency is what made renewable energy which was originally considered as unstable and unreliable actively become adapted. Project Natick was what proved that powering an underwater datacenter with 100% renewable energy is possible. With this finding being the groundwork, now ways of co-locating underwater datacenters and offshore wind farms are being researched.",
            "One interesting fact is that during the two years of the project, a thin coat of algae and barnacles formed on the surface of the datacenter as well as cantaloupe-sized sea anemones on its ballast-filled base. Though it was not enough time for a huge ecosystem to form, this means that many underwater beings found the datacenter as its shelter.",
            "Apart from the effects of underwater datacenters combating climate change, it is still unknown how the increase of underwater datacenters will affect local marine ecosystems.",
